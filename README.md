# PrentestReporter

A python web application that automatically creates penetration test reports from data provided using web UI

Creating a penetration test report is often a time-consuming, boring task. 

Pentesters have to collect notes, screenshots, POC's, comments...etc of all their findings into a well-documented, easy-to-read report.

While Microsoft Word and Excel are essential tools, they take time to format, adjust and create statistics which is not effeciant for long reports.

The time spent to create a report can be used to do more important tasks such as actual penetration testing.

With a friendly web interface, this project allows you to create pentest projects, add your findings and generate a report with a single click.
